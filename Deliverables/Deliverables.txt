5. “studyBuddie” is a student-focused productivity app that is designed to make studying more social and personalized while also being efficient at the same time. 
Users will be able to create and share study schedules, track assignment progress, set daily or weekly goals, and do everything a student might need to do. 
We might implement something with AI, such as a personal assistant that can give you study recommendations, help you plan efficiently, etc…

6. Our audience is mainly focused on students, who are looking for an application that is more than a to-do list. They want an all-in-one platform where students 
manage their workload and optimize their study habits. 

7. For Learners who want to be more productive and scheduled. The studyBuddie is a productivity tracker that offers an all-in-one platform to manage their workload and optimize their 
study habits. Unlike many apps out there, such as Google Calendar or Todoist for students, our app combines task management, peer interaction, 
and possibly AI-driven personalized study recommendations in one app, encouraging collaboration and accountability. 

9. We will use Agile Methodology. Using tools like Kanban.

10. We plan to meet 2 twice a week, and communicate through Discord. We have a server in Discord, with multiple channels based on what is being done, and have a voice channel where members
can easily join to discuss the project. 

11. Team Meetings: Monday at 5 pm online on Discord. Thursday, 5:30 pm in Engineering Center. Weekly Meetings: 10:45 AM on Thursday, online on Zoom
